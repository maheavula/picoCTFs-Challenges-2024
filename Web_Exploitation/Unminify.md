## Description

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Browse here(http://titan.picoctf.net:65472/) and find the flag!

## Hint

  - Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl <URL> in your shell.
  - Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
  - What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

## Solution

  - To be honest, I looked at in differet places but it hides somewhere in the code.. So finally I cought it here.
