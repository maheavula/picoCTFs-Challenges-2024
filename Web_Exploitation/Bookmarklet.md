## Description

Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?

Browse here(http://titan.picoctf.net:50595/) , and find the flag!

## Hint

  - A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.
  - What happens when you click a bookmarklet?
  - Web browsers have other ways to run JavaScript too.
