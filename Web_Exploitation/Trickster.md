  - I upload a radndom png file but it gave nothing and hopefully we get back to you.
  - So i tried we jpeg file then i thrown a errow information with jpeg magic byes.
  - Later i got to understand that it is file upload vulnerability, we need to exploit so the thing here we need to add PNG magic bytes to starting of file with php script.
  - After adding magic bytes to file and save the file with `filename.png.php` to trick the website, so now it has both png bytes in starting and php script to exploit the vulnerability to find the flag.

  - Uploading it in website, we can get a shell to execute commands in server so files upload in uploads foder, right , then enter the path like `/upload/filename.png.php/` to get the shell.

  - Here is a shell, i listed files but it is showing only a file then i found where i am right now, it is in /var/www/html/file.
  -  Then by using find command to find all txt file i used this command, `find / -name "*.txt"` this command search all txt files from root directory.

  - so finally the flag found in the `/var/www/html/GAZWIMLEGU2DQ.txt` file.

  - The flag is `picoCTF{c3rt!fi3d_Xp3rt_tr1ckst3r_03d1d548}`.
