## Description

Try here(http://titan.picoctf.net:59790/) to find the flag

## Hint

  - Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.
  - Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

## Solution

  - After opening the challenge website,  we can see that registration page to fillup the details.
  - We can enter any random details in fields, that will not problem, so I enter random text in the fields.

  - Then submiting you can see 2fa authentication to enter otp field but how to get the otp...?

  - Entered random digits but responded as invalid otp so trying many ways I taught to remove otp paramater in the request.

  - I requested without otp prarameter so finally it gave flag.

  -   The flag is `picoCTF{#OTP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_9090d63c}`.
